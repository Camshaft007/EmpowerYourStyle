        <p>Transform your wardrobe into a space that serves your needs with ease and simplicity. Letting go of clothes that no longer align with your style and taste can be liberating, and I'm here to guide you through the process. Together, we'll uncover hidden gems of your wardrobe and create fresh combinations with your existing pieces.</p>

        <p>With an objective eye, I will identify the items that can be repurposed, modernised, and paired with new additions to revamp your wardrobe. Our collaborative efforts will streamline your closet and put an end to the never-ending 'what do I wear' dilemmas.</p>

        <p>By the end of our session, your wardrobe will be a reflection of your unique style, free from any clothing guilt. You'll have an organised space that inspires you every day, making getting dressed a breeze.</p>

        <p>The Wardrobe Cleanser can take anywhere between 2-5 hours depending on the size of your wardrobe and your goals. With a minimum booking of 2 hours, we'll review your wardrobe and identify its gaps. You'll get a personalized shopping list with suggestions to upgrade your wardrobe and make it work harder for you.</p>

        <p>In a 3–5-hour session, we'll declutter and organize your wardrobe, try on different clothes to create new outfits, and teach you tips and tricks to build outfits that suit YOU - your personality and lifestyle and body shape. You'll have a clear and organized wardrobe, a look book for easy outfit selection, and a list of missing pieces to complete your collection.</p>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p><strong>STYLE CONSULTATION</strong><br>
        When you work with me, we begin each package with an in-depth Style Consultation. This is a crucial starting point, as it allows me to gain an understanding of your personal style, lifestyle, likes and dislikes. During this 30-minute session, we'll delve into what makes you unique, and what your wardrobe needs are, to ensure that the looks I create for you are tailored to your individual style. This step can be done virtually or in person. As personal styling is an intimate and personal service, my top priority is to ensure that you feel comfortable throughout the entire process.</p>

        <p>Following our Style Consultation, we will dive into your wardrobe and let the fun begin! My ultimate goal is to simplify your life and make getting dressed a joyful experience again.</p>

        <h3>What will you gain from this?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Organised wardrobe</li>
            <li>Clothing confidence</li>
