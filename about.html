                <p class="gap-after">Step into the world of personalized styling with me! I'm an Auckland-based stylist with a passion for fashion that's deeply rooted in my personal background. Having grown up in Europe, I've always been captivated by the power of style to transform the way we feel and present ourselves to the world.</p>
                
                <p class="gap-after">My five years in Paris, the fashion capital of Europe, were especially transformative. I was completely captivated by the effortless chic of the Parisians. Their innate sense of style and understated glamour inspired me to pursue my dreams of becoming a stylist.</p>

                <p class="gap-after">Motivated by my experiences in Paris, I embarked on an exciting journey. In 2013, I made the move to Melbourne to study at Australian Style Institute and started my own styling business. It has been a fulfilling and rewarding adventure, and I'm thrilled to share my knowledge and expertise with clients in both Melbourne and Auckland.
                My purpose is to make styling accessible to individuals like you, who may have never considered using a stylist before.</p>
                
                <p class="gap-after">I love helping both men and women refine their wardrobes and feel confident and comfortable in their own skin. Whether you're in a corporate setting or a more casual environment, I'm here to help you create a wardrobe that reflects your unique personality and style.</p>
